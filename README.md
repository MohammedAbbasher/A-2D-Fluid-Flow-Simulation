# A-2D-Fluid-Flow-Simulation

This project is an exercise to practice fluid dynamics phenomenon simulation using C++.

The first step towards this aim is to understand preexisting codes. Thus the code that appears on this respiratory is an attempt to simplify Mike Ash's code which aims to simulate real-time 3D fluid simulation and volumetric rendering. The code is based on Jos Stam's paper entitled 'Real-Time Fluid Dynamics for Games' and can be found at: https://www.mikeash.com/pyblog/fluid-simulation-for-dummies.html. 


The simulation process is based on two famous physical phenomena diffusion and advection. 


Here, the code is simplified to simulate 2D flows instead of 3D flows, rewritten in C++ instead of C, and reorganized in a more readable way.

The next step in this project is to add more features and then extend it to python for post-processing.
